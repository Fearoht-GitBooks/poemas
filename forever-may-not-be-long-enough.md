# Forever May Not Be Long Enough

Forever may not be long enough for my love

I have a will,

But I’m lost inside your time

If you could,

Would you come with me

To the other side?

Forever may not be long enough

For this love



This word is never enough,

And I’m not givin’ up

My faith in love is like blood,

I’d spill it freely for some

My faith in love is like blood,

If flows in everyone

Don’t stop to look at the clock,

Forever won’t be long enough



Forever may not be long enough for you to know

Just how far I’d travel,

Just how far I would go

Open your heart and everything will be alright

Open your heart,

Baby leave with me,

Don’t be afraid

This word is never enough,

And I’m not givin’ up

My faith in love…
